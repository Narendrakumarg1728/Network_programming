Initially server will create a socket with the port provided and will be binded to use any client IP address.
Using the socket created server will start to listen to any client which will try to contact at that port.
Similarly Client will create a socket on the port where the server will be listening and will try to connect to the server with the server IP address and the port.
The server stays in passive open state untill the client raises a request. 
Once the client request for the connection, the server accepts the request.
Once the connection is accepted the server reads the commands sent by the client.
Server will execute the received command and execute it on the shell prompt of the server and responses back to the client with the out put obtained from the shell.
Client will display this message.

Server will ignore bad commands and will not be affected by client crashes.
